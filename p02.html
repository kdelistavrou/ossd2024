        <p><b>Summer in the city</b></p>
        <p>I love very much the sea and swimming. Today the  
           sun shines. I will take one of the ferries that depart from the harbour 
           of Thessaloniki, to visit one of the nearby beaches of Thermaikos. 
           I will not use my car, so that I will not have to fill it with gas.
           I'll also hold an umbrella, in case clouds gather and it rains.
           I will not carry my mobile, to have peace of mind. 
           At night I will return with the last ferry, to watch the football game 
           for the cup on the television.</p>
